This is for building linux binary wheels. So "pip install pygame" works on linux.

manylinux is an older linux with a fairly compatable ABI, so you can make linux binary
wheels that run on many different linux distros.

The basic idea is that we build the pygame dependencies, and then bundle them up in a .whl file.
To do this we use docker containers so that the dependencies do not need to be built every time.

Below are instructions on using a vagrant virtual machine, so we can build the wheels from
mac, windows or linux boxes.


These aren't meant to be copypasta'd in. Perhaps these can be worked into a script later::

    # You should be in the base of the pygame repo when you run all this.

    # Download many megabytes of ubuntu.
    vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

    # now we are on the vagrant ubuntu host
    # We set up docker following these instructions for ubuntu-xenial
    # https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
    vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get purge lxc-docker
    apt-cache policy docker-engine
    sudo apt-get install docker-engine

    # Now edit /etc/hosts so it has a first line with the hostname ubuntu-xenial in it.
    # Otherwise docker does not start.
    # 127.0.0.1 localhost ubuntu-xenial
    # makes a /etc/hosts.bak in case something breaks.
    sudo sed -i".bak" '/127.0.0.1 localhost/s/$/ ubuntu-xenial/' /etc/hosts

    # We should have been in our python package clone root directory before we ran vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant

    # install auditwheel to create the wheel.
    # https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel
    #sudo apt install python3-pip
    #pip3 install auditwheel

    # We need to be able to run docker as the ubuntu user.
    sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    # now log out of vagrant. Need to reload it because docker.
    exit

    vagrant reload
    vagrant ssh

    # now we can start docker. Should be started already.
    sudo service docker start

    cd /vagrant/manylinux-build
    make

    # Now perhaps the whl files build correctly.
    ls -la wheelhouse

    export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk
    export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy

    python3.5 -m venv anenv35
    . ./anenv35/bin/activate
    pip install wheelhouse/pygame-*cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
    python -m pygame.tests --exclude opengl,music


    # Now upload all the linux wheels to pypi.
    # Make sure your PYPI vars are set. See .travis_osx_upload_whl.py
    cd ..
    mkdir -p dist
    rm -f dist/*.whl
    cp manylinux-build/wheelhouse/*.whl dist/

    pip install twine

    python .travis_osx_upload_whl.py --no-git
